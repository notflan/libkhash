* libkhash - kana-hash
  Kana mnemonic hashes

** Installation
   The dynamic library is built with ~Cargo~ and ~Rust~, and the cli example program is built with ~gcc~.

*** Build and install
    The default build configuration builds both the dynamic library and the cli example program, and copies them to =/usr/lib/libkhash.so= and =/usr/bin/kana-hash= respectively.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ make && sudo make install
    #+END_SRC

    The install path can be changed by editing the ~INSTALL~ and ~INSTALL-BIN~ paths in the [[file:./Makefile][Makefile]].

*** Uninstall
    To remove installed binaries, run:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo make uninstall
    #+END_SRC

*** Other build configurations
    The Makefile contains some other build directives.

**** Native code optimisations
     By default =libkhash= builds the shared library with native architecture optimisations enabled.
     If you are intending to move the binary to another architecture, this might not be desireable.
     To build without such optimisations, run:

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ make khash-nonative
     #+END_SRC

**** Tests
     To build and run all tests, run:

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ make test
     #+END_SRC

**** Building the CLI
     The default =make= directive builds both the library and the CLI example program.
     To build just the CLI example program, run:

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cd cli && make
     #+END_SRC

** TODO Rust crate

** C header
   A header file is provided for C programs wanting to use the khash interface.
   Documented more fully in [[file:./include/khash.h][./include/khash.h]].
   All symbols defined here begin with either =KHASH_= (for macros) or =khash_=.

*** Example
    To create a context
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  #include <khash.h>

  const char* input_salt = "salt!";
  const char* input_data = "some data to hash".
  khash_context ctx;
  assert(khash_new_context(KHASH_ALGO_SHA256, KHASH_SALT_TYPE_SPECIFIC, input_salt, strlen(input_salt), &ctx) == KHASH_SUCCESS, "khash_new_context() failed.");
#+END_SRC
    Find the buffer length we need.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  size_t length;
  assert(khash_length(&ctx, input_data, strlen(input_data), &length) == KHASH_SUCCESS, "khash_length() failed.");
#+END_SRC
    Create the buffer and hash, then print the result to ~stdout~.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  char* buffer = alloca(length+1);
  assert(khash_do(&ctx, input_data, strlen(input_data), buffer, length) == KHASH_SUCCESS, "khash_do() failed.");
  buffer[length] = 0; // Ensure we have a NUL terminator.

  setlocale(LC_ALL, ""); //Ensure we can print UTF-8.
  printf("Kana hash: %s\n", buffer);
#+END_SRC

*** Definitions

**** Macros
    All macros defined are for options.
    They cannot be combied as flags.
    The =KHASH_ALGO_= prefixed ones are for use as the /algo/ parameter in the ~khash_new_context()~ function.
    The =KHASH_SALT_TYPE_= prefixed ones are for use as the /salt_type/ parameter.
    The =KHASH_ERROR_= prefixed ones each indicate an error code returned by all of the functions.

**** Types
    There are 2 exported structs, although you will rarely need to access their members directly.
    | Name            | Field       | Description                                                                                                                                  |

    | ~khash_salt~    |             | A salt allocated into a context by ~khash_new_context()~ and released by ~khash_free_context()~. You shouldn't mess with its field directly. |
    |                 | /salt_type/ | The type of the salt.                                                                                                                        |
    |                 | /size/      | The size of the salt.                                                                                                                        |
    |                 | /body/      | A pointer to the body of the salt. (The memory allocated here is not guaranteed to be of the provided /size/.)                               |
    |-----------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ~khash_context~ |             | A context for the =khash_= functions. Allocated by ~khash_new_context()~. You can modify its fields if you want.                             |

**** Functions
    All defined functions return either ~KHASH_SUCCESS~ or one of the =KHASH_ERROR_= values [[Macros][above]].
    | Name                  | Parameters                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    |-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ~khash_new_context~   | /algo/, /salt_type/, /data/, /size/, /output/  | Creates a new context for use with other =libkhash= functions. /algo/ is expected to be one of the =KHASH_ALGO_= macros listed [[Macros][above.]] Likewise /salt_type/ is expected to be one of the =KHASH_SALT_TYPE_= macros. /data/ can be ~NULL~ unless /salt_type/ is set to ~KHASH_SALT_TYPE_SPECIFIC~, in which exactly /size/ bytes are read from /data/. /output/ is expected to be a valid pointer to a currently unused `khash_context` structure. |
    | ~khash_free_context~  | /ctx/                                          | Free a context allocated with ~khash_new_context()~.  /ctx/ is expected to be a valid pointer to a currently allocated context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | ~khash_clone_context~ | /src/, /dst/                                   | Clone a context allocated with ~khash_new_context()~ into another. The newly allocated /dst/ must be properly released (with ~khash_free_context()~ or ~khash_do()~) as well as the source. /src/ is expected to be a valid pointer to an allocated context, and /dst/ is expected to be a valid pointer to an unallocated context.                                                                                                              |
    | ~khash_length~        | /ctx/, /data/, /size/, /length/                | Compute the length required to hold the output string for ~khash_do()~ for a given input. Will read exactly /size/ bytes from /data/ and compute the value into what is pointed to by /length/ (which is expected to be a valid pointer to a type of ~size_t~.) The resulting length does not include a =NUL= terminator for the string.                                                                                                         |
    | ~khash_do~            | /ctx/, /data/, /size/, /output/, /output_size/ | Compute the kana-hash of /size/ bytes from /data/ and store no more than /output_size/ of the the result into the string pointed to by /output/. Each pointer is expected to be valid. This function frees the supplied /ctx/ after the hash has been computed, and thus /ctx/ is no longer valid afterwards.                                                                                                                                    |

** Node FFI bindings
   NPM package in [[file:./node/index.js][./node]]

*** Installation (npm)
    Follow the [[installation]] section first.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ npm install --save /path/to/repo/node
    #+END_SRC

*** Examples

**** Import the package
     #+BEGIN_SRC javascript 
  const hash = require('kana-hash');
     #+END_SRC

**** Create a context
     Create the context by specifying an algorithm identifier, and an optional salt.
     If provided, the salt must be of type `Salt`.
     #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  const ctx = new hash.Kana(hash.Kana.ALGO_DEFAULT, new hash.Salt("optional salt~"));
     #+END_SRC

**** Create a hash
     The `once()` function consumes the context and outputs a hash string.
     #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  const output = ctx.once("input string");
     #+END_SRC

***** Creating a hash without consuming
      If you want to reuse the context, use the `hash()` function.
      #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  const output = ctx.hash("input string");
      #+END_SRC

***** Freeing the context
      The context must be release after use if you have not called `once()`.
      #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  ctx.finish();
      #+END_SRC

***** Cloning an existing context
      The new context must also be freed with either `once()` or `finish()`.
      #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  const new_ctx = ctx.clone();
      #+END_SRC

*** Interface documentation
    The 2 exported objects are ~Kana~ and ~Salt~.
    ~Kana~'s constructor expects between 0 and 2 arguments.
    + The first is either an [[Defined constants][algorithm definition]] or empty, if empty ~Kana~ uses the default algorithm (truncated SHA256).
    + The second is either an instance of ~Salt~ or empty, if empty ~Kana~ uses the default library salt.
    ~Salt~'s constructor expects 0 or 1 argument.
    + Either a string to use as the specific salt or empty, if empty there is no salt.
